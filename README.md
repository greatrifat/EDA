# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Reports

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reports and code for analyzing two datasets: **Bank Loan Defaulters** and **Telco Customers**. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer behaviors, identify trends, and help make data-driven decisions for improved business strategies.

## Datasets

### Bank Loan Defaulters
The **Bank Loan Defaulters** dataset includes records of loan applications and outcomes for a bank's customers. The analysis identifies customer profiles that are more or less likely to default on loans, covering factors such as income level, employment type, family status, and loan characteristics. These insights assist in risk assessment and can inform the bank's lending strategies.

### Telco Customers
The **Telco Customers** dataset contains information about customers of a telecom company, including demographics, services used, and churn status. The EDA reveals patterns related to customer churn, helping identify characteristics of loyal customers versus those likely to leave. This analysis can guide customer retention efforts and enhance service strategies.

## How to Use
